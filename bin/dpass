# This command intended to be set in SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable.
# It allows dmenu to be a graphical sudo agent.

# The `-p "$1"` causes dmenu to substitute `$1` as the prompt text, 
# this is what SUDO_ASKPASS must do.

# Then we set the foreground and background colours.
# We also set the foreground and background selected colours.
# This intended to make sure the password cannot be seen.

# The `<&-` will close STDIN, and dmenu will show an empty menu.

# Once the user enters their password dmenu will output the resulting text.
# Finally we will output a literal newline as sudo expects a terminating newline.

dmenu -p "$1" -nf '#000000' -nb '#000000' -sf '#cccccc' -sb '#cccccc' <&- && printf '\n'
